        Design is Sebastian's greatest passion. He loves many areas of life. He is<br>
        an avid basketball fan, he loves to paint abstract artwork, he loves to listen<br>
        to and play folk music on his guitar (not very well I may add), and he loves<br>
        memes as much as most other people in gen z.<br>
        <br>
        But even with all these passions...<br>
        <br>
        Art and Design are still number one. He loves learning about design and<br>
        experiencing it out in the world. His interests reflect back onto his ability<br>
        to design, and they are fundamental to who he is as a person and what he is<br> 
        capable of designing.
